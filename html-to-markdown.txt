Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community

Certainly! Migrating from **Confluence** to **Microsoft Loop** can be a strategic move, especially considering the integration with **Microsoft 365** and the delightful presence of **MS Copilot**.

Allow me to ask:

*   I would like to know what @domain and who is hosting your email account? example for @domains: [Gmail.com](http://Gmail.com), [http://Yahoo.com](http://Yahoo.com) , [Outlook.com/Hotmail.com](http://Outlook.com/Hotmail.com)
    
    *   May I know if the account is for **Work/School use? or Personal (Hotmail/Outlook.com) use?**
        
*   What version and edition of Office do you have installed in your device? Example: Personal/Family/Enterprise?
    
*   What error message are you getting?

Let’s explore your options for content migration:

1.  **Manual Copy-Paste**:
    
    *   As you’ve mentioned, this is the most straightforward approach. You can manually copy the content from Confluence and paste it into Microsoft Loop. While it’s simple, it might be time-consuming for large amounts of content.
        
2.  **Export to PDF and Store on SharePoint**:
    
    *   Although not ideal, exporting your Confluence content to PDF and storing it on SharePoint is a viable option. However, it lacks the dynamic and collaborative features that you’d get with native Loop content.
        
3.  **Alternative Workaround**:
    
    *   While there isn’t a direct built-in export/import feature between Confluence and Loop, consider this workaround:
        
        *   Open your Confluence page in edit mode.
            
        *   Copy all the content using keyboard shortcuts.
            
        *   Go to your Azure DevOps wiki (Loop) and choose the “Paste as HTML” option from the toolbar.
            
        *   Paste the content there.
            
    *   This method preserves the formatting and structure, but it’s still a manual process.
        
4.  **Keep an Eye Out for Future Enhancements**:
    
    *   Microsoft Loop is evolving, and new features may be added over time. Keep an eye on updates and announcements for any direct migration tools or improvements. Please note that Microsoft Loop is still new and still improving its performance and feature for all users if you have any suggestion, feedback, and feature ideas for improving Microsoft Loop please feel free to submit them.

Remember that each option has its trade-offs, and you’ll need to weigh them based on your specific needs. Good luck with your migration, and may your content flow seamlessly from Confluence to Loop! 

I hope this helps!

Thank you,

Vince
